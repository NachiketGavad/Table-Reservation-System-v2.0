# Table Reservation System v2.0

Table Reservation System for Restaurants.

**Database name**: "tabresnew"

## Modules

The system is divided into 4 modules:

1. **Customer**: Customers can make reservations by providing their details and reservation dates. Data is stored in the database.

2. **Owner**: Owners can manage various aspects of their restaurant, including menus, managers, and transactions.

3. **Manager**: Managers are appointed by owners to handle day-to-day operations of the restaurant. They have fewer privileges than owners.

4. **Project Admin**: Admins oversee the system and handle owner registration requests. They verify accounts before owners can access their sections.

## Features

- **Owner Registration**: Users can register as owners to use the system for showcasing their hotel. Admin verifies accounts before granting access to the owner section.

- **Menu Management**: Owners can view and manage the list of menus added by themselves or managers for the hotel.

- **Manager Management**: Owners can view and manage the list of managers appointed for the hotel.

- **Transaction Management**: Owners can view and manage transaction details currently in the system.

## Usage

1. **Owner Registration**: If a user wishes to use the system but doesn't have an owner account, they can register. After verification by the Admin, they gain access to the owner section.

2. **Customer Reservation**: Customers visit the website, fill in their details and reservation dates, which are then stored in the database.
